  # Decode value as zip
  ... | zip
  # Decode file using zip options
  $ fq -d zip -o uncompress=true . file
  # Decode value as zip

Supports ZIP64.

Timestamp and time zones
========================
The timestamp accessed via .local_files[].last_modification is encoded in ZIP files using MS-DOS representation
(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/oleauto/nf-oleauto-dosdatetimetovarianttime) which lacks a known time zone.
Probably the local time/date was used at creation. The unix_guess field in last_modification is a guess assuming the local time zone
was UTC at creation.
